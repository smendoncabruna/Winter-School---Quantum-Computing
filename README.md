## :eyes: Overview

- **Description:** This course intends to introduce aspects of quantum computing that are not always covered in Physics classes, as they involve computational concepts such as complexity, circuit model and algorithms. We will get our hands dirty using Qiskit, IBM's quantum programming language.
- **Workload:** 8h
- **Requirements:** linear algebra, familiarity with programming (preferrably Python)
- **Bibliography:**
    - Nielsen, Michael A., and Isaac Chuang. "Quantum computation and quantum information." (2002): 558-559.
    - Lecture Notes for Physics 219: Quantum Computation https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.70.9272&rep=rep1&type=pdf
    - Qiskit textbook: https://qiskit.org/textbook/preface.html
